=== Optimizers
==== CSSO
((/tools/optimizers/csso CSSO)) (CSS Optimizer) is a CSS minimizer unlike others.

In addition to usual minification techniques it can perform structural optimization of CSS files,
resulting in smaller file size compared to other minifiers.

==== SVGO
((https://github.com/svg/svgo/#readme SVGO)) (SVG Optimizer) is a NodeJS-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files.

SVG files, especially exported from various editors, usually contain a lot of redundant and useless information
such as editor metadata, comments, hidden elements and other stuff that can be safely removed without affecting
SVG rendering result.

SVGO has a plugin-based architecture, so almost every optimization is a separate plugin, and you can easily
add your own.
